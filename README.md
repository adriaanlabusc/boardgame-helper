Deploy with `now -e KIK_PROD_API_KEY=@kikprodapikey`, a new url will have been copied to your clipboard where you can see the app. 

This does not replace the older deploys. You can take the new deploy into production by running `now alias set <url-from-clipboard-here>  boardgame-helper.now.sh`



Some deployment related docs that may be hard to find: 

* Run: `now alias -h`

To run locally check out [kik bot starter kit](https://github.com/JonathanZWhite/kik-bot-starterkit). This may not work at the moment :monkey_face:.
